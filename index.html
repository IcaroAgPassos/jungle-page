                    It can be called a tropical forest if it occupies only 3% of the national territory.</p>

                                    The Amazon is a vast biome in South America, predominantly in Brazil. It is an incredibly diverse rainforest, home to up to 10% of the planet's species. Characterized by a humid equatorial climate, its network of rivers, led by the Amazon, covers about 7 million km², influencing climate regulation. Indigenous populations have inhabited the region for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature. However, it faces significant threats from illegal deforestation, agriculture and mining, undermining biodiversity and carbon cycles. Its role as the "lung of the world" in absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen highlights its global importance. Amazon conservation is vital to the planet's health and future sustainability.
